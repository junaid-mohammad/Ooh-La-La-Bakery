# Ooh La La Bakery

This repository contains the initial design overview for **Ooh La La Bakery**, a concept website created on Canva to support a friend's potential home bakery startup. While there's no source code yet, the plan is to soon turn this design into a live website, and the source code will follow.

## Live Website

## Purpose

This project was a creative exercise focused on mastering the four pillars of effective web design: color theory, typography, user interface (UI), and user experience (UX). By applying these principles, I aimed to create a visually engaging and user-friendly layout for a bakery brand.

## Features

- **Color Theory**: Employed complementary and analogous palettes to convey a warm, friendly atmosphere suitable for a bakery.
- **Typography**: Integrated serif and sans-serif fonts to improve readability and aesthetic appeal.
- **UI Design**: Prioritized layout consistency, alignment, and whitespace for a clean, accessible design.
- **UX Principles**: Ensured simplicity and intuitiveness, designed for all platforms with a mobile-first approach, and followed F and Z reading patterns.
- **Ethical Design**: Avoided dark patterns, focusing instead on transparent, user-centered interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Canva**: Utilized to create an engaging visual design without needing to code.
- **Color Theory & Typography Knowledge**: Applied design principles within Canva for storytelling through colors and fonts.

## What I Learned

- **Color Palettes**: Enhanced my ability to create thematic color schemes for brand storytelling.
- **Typography**: Improved skills in selecting fonts that balance readability and style.
- **UI/UX Design**: Deepened understanding of structuring web layouts that meet user needs and ensure a positive browsing experience.
- **Testing & Feedback**: Reinforced the importance of user testing for effective and intuitive UX.

## Contribution

Feedback and suggestions are welcome to improve the design, particularly for user experience enhancements. Contributions will be considered for the live website development phase.
